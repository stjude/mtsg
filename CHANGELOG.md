# Changelog

## 3.1.0 - 2021-05-14

### Changed

  * templates/plot: Update COSMIC SBS signatures URL. This changed from
    `https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures/SBS/<signature>.tt` to
    `https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/sbs/<lower(signature)>/`.

  * templates/signatures: Update COSMIC mutational signatures URL in footer.

## 3.0.1 - 2020-12-04

### Fixed

  * main: Fix argument matching for `--genome-build` when missing.

## 3.0.0 - 2020-12-04

### Added

  * commands: Add `init` command to install reference mutational signature
    matrices.

### Changed

  * [BREAKING] The underlying profile extractor changed from
    [MutationalPatterns] to [SigProfilerSingleSample]. SigProfiler maps against
    96 mutational contexts (COSMIC Mutational Signatures v3.1 (June 2020))
    rather than the 30 used in v2 (March 2015).

  * [BREAKING] Only the `run` and `visualize` commands remain to run profile
    extraction and create a signature activities plot, respectively.

  * [BREAKING] commands/visualize: Query samples are plotted against a given
    reference dataset, grouped by disease. Summary, sample, and contribution
    plots are now drawn.

[SigProfilerSingleSample]: https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures/sigprofiler.tt

## 2.3.0 - 2020-09-21

### Added

  * main: Add context to error messages.

  * visualizations: Show signature etiologies.

### Changed

  * vcf: Skip the genotype when it is fully missing (i.e., `.`) or every field
    is missing (e.g., `.:.`).

## 2.2.0 - 2020-05-11

### Added

  * vcf: When splitting a VCF, warn when the output VCF already exists.

  * sample-sheet: When creating a sample sheet, warn when no VCFs are loaded.

### Changed

  * Raise mininum supported Rust version to 1.40.0.

  * visualize: Link to COSMIC Mutational Signatures v2.

## 2.1.0 - 2019-05-16

### Changed

  * Rather than the default set of ten repeated colors, the colors used in the
    signature contributions stacked bar chart are distinct.

## 2.0.0 - 2019-03-20

### Changed

  * [BREAKING] Renamed project to Mutational Signatures (mtsg). Update bin
    references from `mutspec` to `mtsg`. The CLI commands remain the same.

  * Return an error instead of crashing when the default COSMIC signature
    probabilities cannot be downloaded.

### Fixed

  * Both variants of SJIDs are parsed to extract the disease code for the
    sample sheet. This fixes codes like AMLM7 previously being extracted as
    AMLM.

## 1.0.0 - 2018-09-04

  * Initial release
